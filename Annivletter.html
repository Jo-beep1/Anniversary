            <p>Happy 1 Year Anniversary!</p>
             <p>Dear Matilda,</p>
            <p>Happy 1 Year Anniversary!</p>
            <p>It's hard to believe it's been a whole year since we embarked on this journey together. Time flies when you're in love, doesn't it?</p>
            <p>Reflecting on the past year fills my heart with warmth and gratitude. We've shared countless memories, laughter, and even a few tears. Through it all, one thing remains constant - my love for you.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being my partner, my confidante, and my best friend. Your presence in my life brings me immeasurable joy, and I'm so grateful to have you by my side.</p>
            <p>As we celebrate this milestone, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You're the sunshine on my darkest days, the melody in my heart, and the love of my life.</p>
            <p>Here's to us and to many more adventures together. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.</p>
            <p>With all my love,</p>
            <p>Rylie</p>
